# C# Programming Challenge: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (OOP, Enum, Switch statements)

### Purpose:

This program will allow the user to play a series of rock, paper, scissors games. The program will determine the winner of each game, display the winner and then allow the user to play additional games.

### This is how the game works:

### Program Procedures:

You are to create a C# console program that will allow a user (player) to play a series of games of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. This program will consist of the player being asked if he would like to play. If the player answers yes then the player should be prompted to select his “hand” (rock, paper, scissors). The computer will then use a random number generator to select its “hand”.

The player shold then be asked if he would like to play another game. If the response is yes, then the game is played again as described above with the results again printed to the screen and the player asked again if he would like to play another game. This continues until player answers no to playing another game.

### Conditions:

1. Part of the prompt to play should include what is considered to be a valid entry (i.e. y for yes, n for no). If the player enters an invalid response, the player should be told and allowed to retry until a valid entry is made.
2. Part of the prompt to select the player’s hand should include what is considered to be a valid entry (i.e. r for rock). If the player enters an invalid response, the player should be told and allowed to retry until a valid entry is made.
3. The winner is determined by the the following guidelines: Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper.
